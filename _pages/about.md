I am currently a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China, supervised by [Dr. Huang Xin](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xinhuang), engaged in Data mining on graphs.
My PhD research work involves: indexing (k, &gamma;)-truss on uncertain graphs; maximizing or maintaining k-truss (truss is a definition of dense subgraph).
I'm also interested in some classic graph algorithms, such as shortest path search and densest subgraph search.
Given a research problem, I would prefer to solve it first by some simple methods. 
During the coding process, I may find limitations or better algorithms, and then implement them again.
After many iterations, I may find satisfactory algorithms.
Therefore, I also have rich experience in C++ development.

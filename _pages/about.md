I received the PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China in 2024.
My research interests involve database management and data mining on graphs.
My PhD research work involves: indexing (k, &gamma;)-truss on uncertain graphs; maximizing or maintaining k-truss (truss is a definition of dense subgraph).
I'm also interested in some classic graph algorithms, such as shortest path search and densest subgraph search.
Given a research problem, I would prefer to solve it first by some simple methods. 
During the coding process, I may find limitations or better algorithms, and then implement them again.
After many iterations, I may find satisfactory algorithms.
Therefore, I also have rich experience in C++ development.

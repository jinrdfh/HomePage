Research Interests
======
* Database management, Data Mining, Graph theory, Design and analysis of algorithms, Dense subgraph identification and search. The work published in ICDE 2024 investigates how to insert edges into a graph to maximize the k-truss under limited budget conditions. The paper published on SIGMOD 2023 mainly studies the maintenance of k-truss using onion layers on dynamic graphs, which enables updates on large graphs to be completed in a short time. The work published on WWW 2021 investigates how to index and query k-truss on uncertain graphs, which utilizes the relationship between trusses to accelerate calculations.

Work experience
======
* 2018/09-2019/06: <strong>Leader</strong> of a 4-person group, a collaboration project between the school organization Dian and CutOut team, port software ``CutOut 8'' from the Windows platform to the Mac platform. In this project, I learned about the differences between the two platforms and how to communicate with clients. The project completed in 6 months.

* 2017/09-2018/06: <strong>Member</strong> of a 20-person group, a collaboration project between the school organization Dian and the company Maipu, the project is to process DNS services for routers. My task is to implement the module for transmitting debugging information of backend programs, and program testing. I came into contact with a complete project for the first time, learned to standardize the code, and understood the project framework. The project completed in one year.
